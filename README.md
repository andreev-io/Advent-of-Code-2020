# WIN Advent of Code 2020

Run: ```cargo run --bin <dayN> --release```

I finished all problems on time, in 25 days. I think there's something fundamentally *adorable* about code that's abandoned as soon as it produces correct output, even more so if it's only ever run once.

In a way, such code never reaches its final polished form. It never grows up.

Never grow up. Merry Christmas!
